# Restart services one-at-a-time
# Ideally, this would be accomplished by a serial=1, but Ansible doesn't support that and
# likely never will. Instead, we just run the service restart manually, waiting X seconds
# before each iteration, where X is 15 seconds times the "host_id" minus 1. Thus, the
# following host configuration leads to the specified sleep times:
#   * pvchv1: 0s
#   * pvchv2: 15s
#   * pvchv3: 30s
#   * etc.
# This results in a practical sense in a "serial=1" sequence of restarts allowing the service
# to float its primary around after changing a configuration.
