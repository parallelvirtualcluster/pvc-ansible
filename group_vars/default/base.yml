# Node network definitions (used by /etc/network/interfaces and PVC)
# > The "type" can be one of three NIC types: "nic" for raw NIC devices, "bond" for ifenslave bonds,
#   or "vlan" for vLAN interfaces. The PVC role will write out an interfaces file matching these specs.
# > Three names are reserved for the PVC-specific interfaces: upstream, cluster, and storage; others
#   may be used at will to describe the other devices.
# > All devices should be using the newer device name format (i.e. enp1s0f0 instead of eth0).
# > In this example configuration, the "upstream" device is an LACP bond of the first two onboard NICs,
#   with the two other PVC networks being vLANs on top of this device.
# > Usually, the Upstream network provides Internet connectivity for nodes in the cluster, and all
#   nodes are part of it regardless of function for this reason; an optional, advanced, configuration
#   will have only coordinators in the upstream network, however this configuration is out of the scope
#   of this role.
